# 链就码林高手

## 以太坊开发者武器列表

Creation of this list was spurred by product managers at ConsenSys who saw a need for better sharing of tools, development patterns, and components amongst both new and experienced blockchain developers.

This resource is meant to be focused on developer tools, but the repo also includes:

* [Ethereum Ecosystem Resources](https://github.com/EthereumCN/ethereum-developer-tools-list/blob/master/EcosystemResources.md) for useful DApps, educational resources, wallets, and services.

### Contributions are welcome!

Feel free to submit a pull request, with anything from small fixes to tools you'd like to add \(or remove!\). If adding a new tool, **please add a brief description** that you think new developers would understand.

Many thanks to the ~100 contributors including [@corbpage](https://twitter.com/corbpage) and [@pakaplace](https://twitter.com/Parker_Place) of [Meridio](https://meridio.co/) for curating, and @jpantunes for restructuring the list in a more logical way.

* Projects that do not have a working product will not be added.
* Projects that are deprecated or no longer maintained will be removed.
* Projects that are paid/restricted services without open source code or developer reviews will be further vetted.
